# Workshop 2: Machine Learning 101

In this workshop, I present a high-level perspective on Machine Learning and give several hands-on examples. We will start with a brief introduction to the key concepts of machine learning, followed by the hands-on session in which we will cover basics of linear regression, explore datasets and basic classification models. The workshop will be concluded with a practical end-to-end example of a machine learning problem and a way to approach it.
