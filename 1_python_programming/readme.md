# Workshop 1: Python Programming Basics

In this workshop, I focus on the basics of programming and the Python language. The tutorial is divided into three main parts, starting with a brief introduction to what Python is and isn't. This is followed by a quick dive into the interactive hands-on introductory notebook, which explains fundamental Python concepts in detail. Finally, I cover the coding exercises, aiming to solidify and build a more robust understanding of programming concepts.
