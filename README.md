## Credits 📝

Some of the materials are adapted from the **last year's version of this course by Sharon Ho** and a great series of **tutorials on Machine Learning** delivered by last year's team at the [UCL AI Society](https://uclaisociety.co.uk), to which I had a pleasure contributing!

I **highly recommend** having a look at the following resources:
- slides, talk recordings and useful overviews on [the society website](https://uclaisociety.co.uk/our-initiatives/tutorials/2023-2024/),
- Jupyter Notebooks with numerous ML code examples available [on GitHub](https://github.com/UCLAIS/ml-tutorials-season-4)!
- Great [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) by 3Blue1Brown.
- A bit more mathy (but very well explaining!) StatQuest [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest).
